# Bounty Book (MERN)

## Description

The Bounty Book app is designed with the purpose of assisting both bounty hunter and bail bondsmen with capturing wanted felons on the run. This app is a work in progress and has a lot of potential. A bounty hunter can signup/login and bid for open bounties in specific states. Using React Maps, the bounty hunter can click on a state which will then return the open bounties in that state (currently in development). On the other hand, a bail bondsman can signup/login and post bounties that they need help resolving. This app was a team project for the Vanderbilt University Full Stack Bootcamp. With very minimal alloted time for completion, my team and I opted for a very basic MVP with implications of future design structure and functionality. My role in this project was to design and style the UI. Some React bootstrap was used for the card layout, but other than that, the styling was done completely with Vanilla JavaScript. I used React to build the components and integrated them into each respective page. Then, each page is called, in the homepage, using React with switch case functionality. The team repository can be found at my team's <a href="https://github.com/Atticus-Robinson/Bounty_Book" target="_blank">Github Repository</a> where you will see all of the original commit messages from each teammate. Bounty Book is Mobile Responsive.
